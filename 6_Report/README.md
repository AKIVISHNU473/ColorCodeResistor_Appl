# INTRODUCTION
1 An electronic color code is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for resistors, but also for capacitors, inductors, diodes and others.

2 A separate code, the 25-pair color code, is used to identify wires in some telecommunications cables.

3 Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.

4 . As the electronics industry evolved, one of the first things that the industryâ€™s players did was standardize the color code marking on resistors. Resistor manufacturers adopted this color code.

5 Manufacturers typically use a color band system known as the resistor color code

     # 4W'S & 1H 
   
  # WHO
     
   1 The project can be used almost by all the particular organization people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.
     
   # WHAT
   
   1 By this project we can calculate the resistor values .
      
   # WHEN
   
   1 This can be used when ew have to find the capacity of resistor.
      
   # WHERE
   
   1  This can be used in Electrical Labs for validating values of resistors.+
      
   # HOW
   
   1 -> This code is designed in such a way that it askes for the three inputs from the user by given requriments 
   
   2 -> And by that it will match the corresponding color .
   
   3 -> By this it obtains the numbers and ready for calculation
   
   4 -> Finally by performing the mathematical calculations it will present the output .
