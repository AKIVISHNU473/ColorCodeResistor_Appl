# INTRODUCTION
1 An electronic color code is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for resistors, but also for capacitors, inductors, diodes and others.

2 A separate code, the 25-pair color code, is used to identify wires in some telecommunications cables.

3 Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.

4 . As the electronics industry evolved, one of the first things that the industryâ€™s players did was standardize the color code marking on resistors. Resistor manufacturers adopted this color code.

5 Manufacturers typically use a color band system known as the resistor color code
