# INTRODUCTION
   1 An electronic color code is used to indicate the values or ratings of electronic components, usually for resistors, but also for capacitors, inductors, diodes and others.
    
   2  A separate code, the 25-pair color code, is used to identify wires in some telecommunications cables.
   
   3  Different codes are used for wire leads on devices such as transformers or in building wiring.
   
   4 . As the electronics industry evolved, one of the first things that the industryâ€™s players did was standardize the color code marking on resistors. Resistor manufacturers adopted this color code.
   
   5  Manufacturers typically use a color band system known as the resistor color code
   
   
  

   
   # SWOT ANALYSIS
   ![SWOT ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98825305/153276766-15b2d773-c666-4eff-ad48-c455d0638f24.jpg)

     

   # DEFINING SYSTEM 
     
  
  1 This is the system code every color has its own value by which it gets the output by performing the particular mathematical equation.
  
   # Resistor Color Code Mnemonics
   Big (for black) Beautiful (brown) Roses (red) Occupy (orange) Your (yellow) Garden (green) But (blue) 
          Violets (violet or purple) Grow (gray) Wild (white) So (silver) GetSome (gold).
   
   # 4W'S & 1H 
   
  # WHO
     
   1 The project can be used almost by all the particular organization people.At the end,user satisfaction is the goal of the project.
     
   # WHAT
   
   1 By this project we can calculate the resistor values .
      
   # WHEN
   
   1 This can be used when ew have to find the capacity of resistor.
      
   # WHERE
   
   1  This can be used in Electrical Labs for validating values of resistors.+
      
   # HOW
   
   1 -> This code is designed in such a way that it askes for the three inputs from the user by given requriments 
   
   2 -> And by that it will match the corresponding color .
   
   3 -> By this it obtains the numbers and ready for calculation
   
   4 -> Finally by performing the mathematical calculations it will present the output .
